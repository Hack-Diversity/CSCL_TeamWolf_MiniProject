### Getting Started


## Installing Node Packages
go to /server/ directory and type in terminal:
```
npm install
```
Go to /client/ directory and type in terminal:
```
npm install
```
You have successfully installed all the node modules!

## Setting up MongoDB
This project uses a Compass MongoDB that is on the cloud so no setting up is required.

## Starting the Node Server
In new tab/window:
```
$ cd server/
```
then run:
```
$ npm run start
```
Then in another tab/window:
```
$ cd client/
```
then run:
```
$ npm run start
```

## Available Scripts

In the server directory, you can also run:

`npm run devstart`
Runs the server through nodemon, which allows changes to automatically reload when a file is saved.

In the client directory, you can also run:

`npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`npm run eject`
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

## Data Analytics
The folder dataAnalysis contains a Powerpoint presentation about trends in the books, an Excel spreadsheet of recommended books, and the R script that was used for statistical analysis and graphing purposes.
